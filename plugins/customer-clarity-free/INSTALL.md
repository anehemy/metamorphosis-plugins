# Install runbook — Customer Clarity AI System (Free edition)

The free lead-magnet tier of the Customer Clarity AI System by Metamorphosis
Worldwide. One skill, one job: turn a founder's real call transcripts into one
customer avatar written in their customers' own words.

## What this is

A Claude Code plugin bundling a single, self-contained skill:

- **`mw-customer-avatar-builder`** — pulls call transcripts from Fathom or
  Microsoft 365 when either is connected, or accepts pasted transcripts from any
  source (Teams, Zoom, Otter, exports), then builds ONE customer avatar from the
  strongest pattern across the calls. When it detects more than one customer
  type, it names that and points to the full paid system rather than forcing a
  blurry single avatar.

This is the **single-file free edition** — the whole skill lives in one
`SKILL.md` (references flattened inline), so it installs as a plugin here or
uploads as a standalone `.zip` skill on claude.ai. It is deliberately capped at
one avatar; the multi-avatar engine, founder voice, content generation,
scheduled intake, and CRM logging are the **paid edition**.

## Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code installed** on the user's machine.
2. **A public marketplace** (`anehemy/metamorphosis`) — no GitHub account or
   auth needed to install. Claude Code clones the public repo itself.

This plugin ships inside the **metamorphosis** marketplace (one marketplace
repo, multiple plugins under `plugins/`). The marketplace entry uses a relative
source (`./plugins/customer-clarity-free`), so there is no external repo
reference to hijack and nothing to edit before installing.

## Install steps

Run inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add anehemy/metamorphosis
/plugin install mw-customer-clarity-free@metamorphosis
```

Verify: ask Claude "who is my customer really?" or paste a call transcript —
`mw-customer-avatar-builder` should trigger.

## Connector setup (optional, not blocking)

- **Fathom** — the skill pulls recent recordings directly and triages which look
  like real customer calls before analyzing.
- **Microsoft 365** — the skill checks your calendar for call-shaped meetings and
  looks for their transcripts in the Teams meeting Recap and your SharePoint/
  OneDrive files. Retrieval depends on recording/transcription having been turned
  on for that meeting; when a transcript is not found, the skill falls back to
  paste without fuss.
- Neither connector is required. With nothing connected, paste a transcript from
  any source (Teams, Zoom, Otter, Fathom export) and the skill runs the same way.

## What the founder needs on first run

The skill creates its own `customer-clarity/` working folder and, on the very
first analysis, walks the founder through six quick questions to build
`owner_profile.md` (so the founder's own voice is excluded from customer
analysis). Nothing to pre-create — the free skill bootstraps itself, unlike the
paid skills which expect the shared folder to already exist.
